# ScanEatApp_Flutter
This is a mobile app used to get information about products in your fridge such as which products are missing and need to be bought, which products are close to their best before date and a lot more.
The app is developed for iOS & Android developed with the flutter framework and intended to use with a suitable configured Raspberry Pi which tracks the products coming into the fridge by its EAN codes.

This project has been developed as part of the "Digitechnikum" ([learn more] (https://digitechnikum.de/)) in a group of four students.
You can find an older version of the app [here] (https://github.com/MartinRouterKing64/ScanEatApp_Xamarin)
